# Claims Optimization and Error Detection

## Introduction
This project aims to optimize claims processing and detect errors in billing data using predictive modeling. The main objectives are to enhance efficiency, minimize errors, and provide a user-friendly interface.

## Project Structure
- **Data**: The dataset (`dataset.csv`) includes features like `claim_amount`, `cpt_code`, and `claim_status`.
- **Model**: We use a Random Forest Classifier to predict claim denials.
- **Code Organization**:
  - `data_processing.py`: Handles data preprocessing.
  - `model_training.py`: Contains functions for training and saving the model.
  - `frontend.py`: Implements the Gradio interface.
  - `app.py`: The main application script.

## Data Processing
We load and preprocess the data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Feature engineering includes creating dummy variables for `cpt_code`.

## Model Training
The training process involves splitting the data, training the Random Forest model, and evaluating its performance. The trained model is saved using `joblib`.

## Prediction
The `predict_claim_status` function processes new data and makes predictions. We also have a `visualize_data` function to create visualizations for understanding data distributions.

## User Interface
The Gradio interface allows users to input claim details and receive predictions.

## Deployment
To run the application, follow the instructions in the `README.md` file. The application helps stakeholders predict claim denials and optimize billing processes.

## Conclusion
This project can significantly impact the medical billing process by reducing errors and improving efficiency. Future work could include additional features and improvements.
