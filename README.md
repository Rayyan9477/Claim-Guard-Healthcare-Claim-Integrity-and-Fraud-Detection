# Claims Optimization and Error Detection

This project focuses on optimizing claims processing and detecting errors in billing data through predictive modeling. It utilizes historical claims data to train a model that predicts the likelihood of claim denials.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for analysis and model training.
  - `dataset.csv`: Historical claims data including features such as claim amounts, CPT codes, and claim statuses.
  
- **models/**: Stores the trained predictive model.
  - `model.pkl`: The trained model that flags claims likely to be rejected by insurers.
  
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis.
  - `data_analysis.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations to identify patterns in claim denials and errors.
  
- **src/**: Source code for the application.
  - `app.py`: Main entry point of the application, initializes the Gradio or Streamlit app.
  - `data_processing.py`: Functions for loading, cleaning, and preparing the dataset.
  - `model_training.py`: Functions for training the predictive model and saving it.
  - `frontend.py`: User interface for inputting claim data and receiving predictions.
  
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd claims-optimization
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   python src/app.py
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

- Upload your claims data through the frontend interface.
- The model will analyze the data and provide predictions on potential claim denials.
- Review the Jupyter notebook for insights and visualizations related to the claims data.

## Project Objectives

- To enhance the efficiency of claims processing.
- To minimize errors in billing through predictive analytics.
- To provide a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to interact with the model.
